        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Shivani', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Keval'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.

        // You might think we can just do something like this:

        // however what happens when we update that array?

        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        // one way

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in

        // or use the new ES6 Spread

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Shivani Jani',
            age: 26
        };

        // and think we make a copy:

        // how do we take a copy instead?
