# Learn JavaScript in 30 days...
# Day 1: Daily Learning Journal
Hey Guys! Do you think you can learn basic javascript in 30 days???
Yes, You can. Here,I'm going to share a course which I found very intresting. JavaScript30 : https://javascript30.com/.
I'm doing internship with Jas(NewEngage Company). He suggested me to watch this video tutorials.
I learned so many new things through this course. At the end of the Day 1 of my internship I finished 8 of 30 days of Javascript in 30 days course.
You guys heard about console.log() right??? Through this course I learned console.table(). Using console.table() you can see your data in tabular form in your console. 
We can do so many new things only with javaScript(without any FrameWork and library). Day 1 of my intership was productive. Here, I'm listing all the new things which I learned from 
this course. 
`1) Console.table(); 2) How we can use variable in Regular Expression 3) Array Methods(some and every) 4) HSL => For Rainbow Colours 5) CSS Variable updates using javascript 6) Transform - was very fun`

# Day 2: Daily Learning Journal 
At the end of the Day 2 of my internship I finished 15 of 30 days of JavaScript in 30 days course. The Second day went well. I really enjoyed all tutorials and learned new things. I can't imagine that I can make custom video player in 45 mins...but I made it. I also learned Styled using console.log.For Example 
` console.log('%c I'm Some great text','font-size:50px; background:red'); `
we can easily add css inside console.log().we can also use `console.warn()` for Warning, `console.error()` for Error message, `console.assert()` for Testing, `console.groupcollapsed()` for Grouping together, and last but not least `console.timing()` to see time of fetching data.

I also learned Group Checkbox with ShiftKey, few of window Events, transform in css, sprade Array, Break down point in Inspect(browser),Slide in on Scroll(Slide in images on document when we Scroll page), how to store our data in to localStorage(persistence Data), and Event Delegation.
I found fun and interest in custom video player, persistence Data and cornify_Add() Method.

# Day 3: Daily Learning Journal 
Ooooops!!! I did it. Today, I finished 22 of 30 days of JavaScript in 30 days course. It was a little bit challenging day but by end of the day, I'm so happy. I learned so many new things. Most interesting and fun was making Photobooth(unreal Webcam). Here, I'm going to share some features of the photo booth which I made today. Using Photobooth we can take photos, download photos to our computer/laptop and we can see them as real photos with .png file extension. we can also filter the photo such as Red colour effect, very cool RGB split, play with global alpha for ghosting effect and green screen. These all magical things I did with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, we can change the value of RGB colour and get more different colour effects. Get video using MediaDevices and localMediaStream. 

The other cool thing I learned today was Speech Recognition in the browser. Not perfect but it's actually really impressive that we can do this without any libraries or external API. Speech Recognition is a global variable that lives in the browser. It's updating paragraphs when we stop speaking. It needs to run on the server. It works like Siri. When you speak `Hi Siri, "Get the weather" ` It's run the Weather application in the background. For Example,
`if(transcript.includes('Get the weather')`
`{
console.log('Getting the Weather'); // basically we can have a hands-off application...
}`
So, What we are saying behind the scenes those words that we want and it will trigger some sort of other function.

I also learned Geolocation. In Geolocation, we can find the direction of the person currently at also it tell us to speed if someone is running which is kind of cool thing.
