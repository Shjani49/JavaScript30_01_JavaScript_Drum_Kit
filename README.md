# Learn JavaScript in 30 days...
# Day 1: Daily Learning Journal
Hey Guys! Do you think you can learn basic javascript in 30 days???
Yes, You can. Here,I'm going to share a course which I found very intresting. JavaScript30 : https://javascript30.com/.
I'm doing internship with Jas(NewEngage Company). He suggested me to watch this video tutorials.
I learned so many new things through this course. At the end of the Day 1 of my internship I finished 8 of 30 days of Javascript in 30 days course.
You guys heard about console.log() right??? Through this course I learned console.table(). Using console.table() you can see your data in tabular form in your console. 
We can do so many new things only with javaScript(without any FrameWork and library). Day 1 of my intership was productive. Here, I'm listing all the new things which I learned from 
this course. 
`1) Console.table(); 2) How we can use variable in Regular Expression 3) Array Methods(some and every) 4) HSL => For Rainbow Colours 5) CSS Variable updates using javascript 6) Transform - was very fun`

# Day 2: Daily Learning Journal 
At the end of the Day 2 of my internship I finished 15 of 30 days of JavaScript in 30 days course. The Second day went well. I really enjoyed all tutorials and learned new things. I can't imagine that I can make custom video player in 45 mins...but I made it. I also learned Styled using console.log.For Example 
` console.log('%c I'm Some great text','font-size:50px; background:red'); `
we can easily add css inside console.log().we can also use `console.warn()` for Warning, `console.error()` for Error message, `console.assert()` for Testing, `console.groupcollapsed()` for Grouping together, and last but not least `console.timing()` to see time of fetching data.

I also learned Group Checkbox with ShiftKey, few of window Events, transform in css, sprade Array, Break down point in Inspect(browser),Slide in on Scroll(Slide in images on document when we Scroll page), how to store our data in to localStorage(persistence Data), and Event Delegation.
I found fun and interest in custom video player, persistence Data and cornify_Add() Method.

# Day 3: Daily Learning Journal 
Ooooops!!! I did it. Today, I finished 22 of 30 days of JavaScript in 30 days course. It was a little bit challenging day but by end of the day, I'm so happy. I learned so many new things. Most interesting and fun was making Photobooth(unreal Webcam). Here, I'm going to share some features of the photo booth which I made today. Using Photobooth we can take photos, download photos to our computer/laptop and we can see them as real photos with .png file extension. we can also filter the photo such as Red colour effect, very cool RGB split, play with global alpha for ghosting effect and green screen. These all magical things I did with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, we can change the value of RGB colour and get more different colour effects. Get video using MediaDevices and localMediaStream. 

The other cool thing I learned today was Speech Recognition in the browser. Not perfect but it's actually really impressive that we can do this without any libraries or external API. Speech Recognition is a global variable that lives in the browser. It's updating paragraphs when we stop speaking. It needs to run on the server. It works like Siri. When you speak `Hi Siri, "Get the weather" ` It's run the Weather application in the background. For Example,
`if(transcript.includes('Get the weather')`
`{
console.log('Getting the Weather'); // basically we can have a hands-off application...
}`
So, What we are saying behind the scenes those words that we want and it will trigger some sort of other function.

I also learned Geolocation. In Geolocation, we can find the direction of the person currently at also it tell us to speed if someone is running which is kind of cool thing.

# Day 4: Daily Learning Journal 
Yeeee!!!Today, I finished 30 of 30 days of JavaScript in 30 days courses. I'm happy that I learned this 30-days course in 4 days. Today I build a game using JavaScript.It was a really fun and interesting game. I build "Whack-a-mole!". What happens when we run the game we go to get the little mole popping up in random holes for random amounts of time and when we click them we get points. Next, I created a time-down counter that shows us how many seconds are left in some sort of task like we have a quick 5 min break or 15 mins break, lunch break going on...We also set the time that we like to down. Through this exercise, I learned the `Date. now()` which is a static method. Before this I only know about `(new Date()).gettime()`method. Third, I learned to click and drag effect using mouse events and mouse positioning events. I had fun with CSS Rotate for sliders. Multiple scrolling was interesting. It's just a combination of the mouse down, up, leave, out, and the mouse moves events.

I also learned stripe followed along with dropdown. When we hover over the top of bit, it shows the Dropdown but the really cool part about it is that the background of the dropdown seems to be able to transform itself from width and height as well as whenever is on the page. When I first time show it I was thinking how did they do that? It was incredible and what I found is that dropdowns themselves like the content text has those separate elements but there is a sort of div that follows each of those dropdowns around and will reside itself based on whenever it is on the page.

The other cool thing I learned about propagation, bubbling, event capturing and new property "once." These all are part of the Event Listener. Bubbling means the browser will figure out what we clicked on but it also triggers clicks up so, when we click on the innermost one(div) it will trigger an event on the parent too. To stop that we need to use `event.stopPropagatio() // Stop bubbling.`

The sticky Navigation Bar, Video Speed Controller, and SpeechSynthesis were also good. Overall, I learned so many new things.
