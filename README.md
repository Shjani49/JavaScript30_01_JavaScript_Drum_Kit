# learn JavaScript in 30 days...
# Day 1: Daily Learning Journal
Hey Guys! Do you think you can learn basic javascript in 30 days???
Yes, You can. Here,I'm going to share a course which I found very intresting. JavaScript30 : https://javascript30.com/.
I learned so many new things through this course. At the end of the Day 1 of my intership I finished 8 of 30 days of Javascript in 30 days course.
You guys heard about console.log() right??? Through this course I learned console.table(). Using console.table() you can see your data in tabular form in your console. 
We can do so many new things only with javaScript(without any FrameWork and library). Day 1 of my intership was productive. Here, I'm listing all the new things which I learned from 
this course. 
`1) Console.table(); 2) How we can use variable in Regular Expression 3) Array Methods(some and every) 4) HSL => For Rainbow Colours 5) CSS Variable updates using javascript 6) Transform - was very fun`
